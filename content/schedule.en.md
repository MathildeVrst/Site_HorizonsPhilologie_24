      abstract: "Since 2014, the Canada Research Chair in Digital Textualities has been running the [collaborative and digital edition of the Greek Anthology](https://anthologiagraeca.org/) project. In the space of a decade, the project has evolved on three different platforms, brought together numerous researchers from multiple disciplines and at different stages of their careers, and spawned new avenues of research, exploiting the many facets of this thousand-year-old corpus. We propose to take stock of this project, in terms of its successes, discoveries and developments, as well as the challenges still ahead."
      biography : "**Marcello Vitali-Rosati** is a professor in the Department of French Literature at the Université de Montréal and holds the Canada Research Chair in Digital Textualities. He is developing a philosophical reflection on the challenges of digital technologies: the concept of the virtual, digital identity, notions of author and authority, forms of production, legitimization and circulation of knowledge in the age of the web, and the theory of editorialization -- to which he is one of the most active contributors. He is the author of numerous articles and monographs, and also works as a publisher, editing the journal Sens public and co-directing the *Parcours Numériques* collection at the Presses de l'Université de Montréal. As holder of the Chair in Digital Textualities, he leads several projects in digital humanities, particularly in the field of scholarly publishing. These include the development of platforms for publishing enriched journals and monographs, software for editing scientific articles, and a collaborative publishing platform for the Codex Palatinus 23. <br> **Mathilde Verstraete** is a PhD student in digital humanities at the University of Montréal. After obtaining a master's degree in classical languages and literature at the Catholic University of Louvain (Belgium), she joined the Canada Research Chair on Digital Textualities to coordinate the collaborative digital edition of the Greek Anthology.

    - speaker : "Gustavo Fernandez (Ruprecht-Karls-Universität Heidelberg. University Library)"
      subject : "Text-Image Alignment as a Feature of Digital Editions"
      abstract: "Layout analysis is the computational process by which different regions of a scanned image are identified and categorized. It is an important step in any workflow for handwritten text recognition. Depending on the document, the relevant zones can differ in nature, such as columns and lines. In this presentation, I will show how layout analysis can be used to create text-image alignments in scholarly digital editions of handwritten sources. The alignment links the typeset digital text, which — for the most part — maintains the layout conventions of the mechanical printing era, with the different and also feature-rich surface of handwritten sources. As a concrete example, I will present current developments stemming from the University of Heidelberg, particularly in the scholarly journal *Pylon: Editions and Studies of Ancient Texts*. I will argue that text-image alignment is a useful tool not only in editions of ancient and difficult to read documents, but also of any document with a complex layout."
      biography : "Gustavo Fernández Riva is a Research Associate in Digital Humanities at the University Library of Heidelberg and works mainly on technical and conceptual development in the field of Digital Editing. He was awarded a Ph.D. in comparative literature at the University of Buenos Aires in 2018. His main fields of research are written and literary practices in non-typographical societies. His current research projects include using network analysis to study shared manuscript transmission of medieval texts and the creation of an open, collaborative dataset of philological *stemmata*."

    - speaker : "Maxime Guénette (University of Montreal, PhD Student)" 
      subject : "Decoding Ancient Greek: New Perspectives on Handwriting Recognition via *Palatine Anthology*." 
      abstract: "Following the recent technological breakthroughs, there is growing academic enthusiasm for Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR). Its prospects are promising: with the training of models for the recognition of handwriting in historical documents, we can now more easily access to our past. This presentation will focus on how this technology, based on artificial intelligence and deep learning, can be applied to ancient Greek corpus. Considering the case study of the *Codex Palatinus graecus 23* (the key manuscript of the *Palatine Anthology*), we will present the required methodology for training an HTR model to recognize ancient Greek, to deal with specific difficulties inherent to ancient Greek and to non-Latin languages. We will also present the possible solutions developed within the project of a collaborative digital edition of the *Greek Anthology*." 
      biography : "Maxime Guénette is a PhD student in History at the Université de Montréal. His research focuses on religions in the Roman Empire, on the sacralization of space and on ancient globalization. Since 2020, he is editor on the *Anthologia Graeca* platform, and has been working on the integration of English and French translations of epigrams, as well as keywords to identify historical figures and places, and philological notes. He has recently been involved in the IAL (\"Intelligence artificielle littéraire\") project to detect variations in the *Greek Anthology*'s corpus of epigrams. During his internship at the Canada Research Chair on Digital Textualities in Summer 2023, he also worked on the application of HTR (Handwritten Text Recognition) to the *Codex Palatinus graecus 23* using the eScriptorium platform. As a result of this internship, he trained models to recognize ancient Greek in medieval manuscripts such as the *Palatine Anthology*."

      abstract : "Automatic Text Recognition technologies (including HTR and OCR) offer an opportunity to work faster with handwritten documents. However, creating and accessing transcription models remain a challenge. This is the reason why it is important to be able to rely on data created by others. HTR-United presents a solution by offering a catalog which gathers descriptions and redirects towards existing public datasets. After introducing the stakes linked to the publication of training for HTR, we will present the HTR-United ecosystem and its schema for the description of datasets."
      biography : "Alix Chagué is a PhD student in Digital Humanities, member of the ALMAnaCH team at Inria-Paris and part of the CRIHN at the University of Montreal, enrolled both at the University of Montréal and the École Pratique des Hautes Études (Paris). Under the supervision of Laurent Romary, Emmanuel Chateau-Dutier and Michael Sinatra, she works on the appropriation of automatic transcription tools (HTR) by the DH community and by cultural institutions. Her research focuses on the impact of training dataset composition on HTR models. Previous to her PhD, as a Research and Development engineer for Inria, she colaborated with numerous projets involving HTR, including LECTAUREP (French national archives), TIME US (ANR) and DAHN."

      subject : "Reconstructing (and Deconstructing) to Read: The Role of Technology in the Edition of the Herculaneum Papyrus Scrolls"
      abstract : "Working on the edition of papyri often entails the need to address fragmentation. In particular, studying *volumina* that are today preserved divided in several pieces requires to go through a reconstruction task, which has to be based on criteria as correct and verifiable as possible. This finds support today in new digital tools. The recent results in virtual unwrapping and reading carbonized unopened scrolls, on the other hand, suggest a drastic change in perspective: in such cases, it is precisely the compactness of the intact scroll, never touched by any attempts to open it, that poses an obstacle to its reading. This state requires that which we could call a ‘digital fragmentation’, which plays a key role in the complex journey to reading the text. The paper will conclude with some reflections on the prospects and challenges of publishing a virtually unwrapped papyrus."
      biography : "Federica Nicolardi is Assistant Professor of Papyrology at the University of Naples Federico II. She mainly works on Herculaneum papyri, focusing especially on new critical editions and virtual restoration. In 2018 she published the first complete edition of the papyri preserving Philodemus’ *On rhetoric* Book 1. She has just started a project funded by the Fritz Thyssen Foundation (*RECREATE – REConstructing papyrus scrolls and REcovering Ancient TExts with the aid of a new digital tool*) aimed at developing a software tool for the virtual reconstruction of papyrus scrolls. Since 2023 she is a member of the Centro Internazionale per lo Studio dei Papiri Ercolanesi ‘Marcello Gigante’. She has been collaborating with the University of Kentucky project on ‘Digital Restoration of Herculaneum Papyri’ (PI Brent Seales) supervising the spectral imaging and photogrammetry activities carried out at the Officina dei Papiri Ercolanesi (Biblioteca Nazionale di Napoli). She is part of the Papyrology team of the Vesuvius Challenge, an internationalcompetition to read the unopened Herculaneum Papyri using machine learning and computer vision techniques."

      subject : "Aligning Greek and Latin texts to French translations using Large Language Models : an experiment on classical philosophical texts"
      abstract: "Aligning original texts and their translations in several languages is key to understanding how ancient texts became essential matter to our cultural heritage. The recent innovations in massive language models allow us to understand the evolution of the way ancient texts were understood up to this day. It is now possible, with very little amount of parallel training data, to compute semantic equivalences between several languages at once for modern languages. But it is also now possible to fine-tune these existing models for ancient languages. In this paper, we are going to see how fine-tuned multilingual models can be applied to ancient languages to build similarity metrics and help better alignment between a source text and its translation. As a use case, we will align classical philosophical texts in Latin and Greek to modern French translations from the 18th century to the 20th century."
      biography : "Marianne Reboul is a lecturer in Digital Humanities at the École Normale Supérieure de Lyon, specializing in digital humanities and classics, more precisely in “digital classics”. She works in particular on the application of artificial intelligence techniques to ancient languages."

      abstract :  "The goal of this paper is to present collaborative projects for the creation of catalogs of ancient authors derived from the extraction and annotation of bibliographic citations in the corpus of ancient Greek literature. Reflections will address epistemological questions about the ancient language of bibliographic citation and practical issues arising from the use of digital technologies employed for the identification and extraction of this type of language from the ancient Greek textual heritage. Particular emphasis will be placed on the collaborative aspect of the philological and exegetical practice, which, while being revitalized today by the necessary interdisciplinary nature of digital projects, is not new and has parallels in the ancient world."
      biography : Monica Berti works at Leipzig University where she teaches and conducts research in the field of digital humanities applied to ancient history and classical philology. She has been collaborating for many years with the Perseus Project and has been directing several projects concerning the indirect tradition of Greek and Latin sources with a focus on fragmentary literature.

      subject : "Digital Editions and Epigraphic Poetry: Reflections from the 'Epigraphic Poetry in Ancient Campania' Project"
      abstract :  "The paper aims to reflect on the potentialities of ‘collaborative philology’ moving from the experience gained in the project ‘Epigraphic Poetry in ancient Campania’. This research project proposes the first comprehensive study of the Greek, Latin and bilingual metrical inscriptions from ancient Campania, a corpus of around 200 documents, dating from the 3rd cent. BC to the 5th cent. AD. Through the collaboration between scholars of philology, literature, epigraphy, archaeology and the history of law and the dialogue with projects already launched in the field of Digital Epigraphy (*in primis* EDR) including also metrical inscriptions, the project aims to provide a new digital edition, accessible through an open-access platform, as well as information on material (support, palaeography, context of discovery, etc.), linguistic, metric, historical and legal aspects related with these documents. Only in recent years has it been recognized the need to adopt an integrated approach to the study of *carmina epigraphica* which considers in a unitary way the philological-literary aspects and those of a historical-archaeological nature, by recognizing the indissoluble link between written text and support, between text and monument.. Moving from selected case-studies, the paper will address the critical-exegetical advances that such approach can provide."
      biography : "**Serena Cannavale** is Associate professor of Classical Philology at the Department of Humanities (*Dipartimento di Studi Umanistici*) of the University of Naples Federico II and teaches courses of Classical Philogy, History of the classical tradition and Digital classics for undergraduates, graduates and PhD students.

      abstract : "In recent decades, in North America as well as in Europe, the use of critical thinking has become an increasingly important objective in history and literature curricula. The educational community has put in place a large number of resources to support teachers. The purpose of our presentation is to outline the pedagogical and didactic benefits that can be expected from the use of collaborative editions in the history and literature classroom, using the *Greek Anthology* as an example. Integrating these collaborative editions into school curricula would enable students to actively participate in the creation of collaborative educational resources. In addition, we want to show that involving students in the creation of collaborative editions engages them in a process of research and analysis that strengthens their critical thinking skills. By getting them to evaluate interpretations, collaborative editing can prove a powerful tool for developing a set of skills that are increasingly being promoted in school curricula."

He is currently a PhD student in Educational Sciences in the Department of Didactics at the same university, where his research focuses on the engagement of critical thinking in the study of ancient civilizations through the reading of ancient sources, and on the adaptation of ancient documents through the study of curricula. Émile is also interested in the place of classical culture in Quebec and Canada through a comparative approach to European school curricula (Italy, France, Germany...). He is currently a student researcher at the Laboratoire de Recherche en Didactique de l'Histoire in the Faculty of Education at the Université de Montréal, where his research is directed by Prof. Marc-André Éthier."

      subject : "'The medium is the message'? Essay on the ecdotics of epigrams from multiple traditions."
      abstract: "In editing ancient Greek epigrams, more than any other type of texts, the *medium* holds an undeniable value: since epigram is the written genre *par excellence*, the material context has to be regarded as an integral part of the message. What happens when the same epigram is preserved in more than one contexts of transmission? What are the fundamental points in editing these texts and what should be the role of their history in the *constitutio textus*? A few representative examples will be examined, in order to make some epistemological and methodological remarks."

Her main research interests include Greek and Latin poetry on stone, Greek and Latin epigram, the new and the old Posidippus, Hellenistic poetry. Other research themes are Callimachus, ancient biography, history of classical scholarship, didactics of ancient Greek."

      subject : "Epigrams, anthologies, critical editions. For a rethinking of the publishing tradition of *Anthologia Graeca*" 
      abstract: "In this paper, I first consider what does it mean to produce a critical edition of epigrammatic texts, focusing on the ways epigrams have been transmitted from the Hellenistic age to the present day and outlining a brief editorial history of the *Anthologia Graeca*. I will highlight how the editorial praxis established since the first half of the 19<sup>th</sup> century is questionable from a methodological point of view and in need of rethinking. I will therefore present alternative criteria for publishing. I will then emphasise the relevance of the editions of each of the epigrammatic anthologies that have survived to this day, starting with the *Planudea*, whose inner organisation is the result of a precise editorial project that deserves to be fully valued. I will conclude with a few examples of the specific problems that an editor of a Sylloge Minore may encounter, mainly based on my *ongoing* edition of the *Sylloge Parisina*. This is intended to indicate some possible research directions for future epigrammatic studies."

      subject : "On How to edit Greek Riddles : Questions and Answers"
      abstract : "The edition of Greek riddles, especially those composed during the Byzantine period, is often troublesome. In fact, the same text is sometimes witnessed in quite different versions depending on the manuscripts in which it appears: we do not find the typical textual variants present in other similar compositions (epigrams, for example), often limited to a single word, but with much more significant differences, which may even concern one or more verses. After presenting some examples of these variants, the paper will propose some publishing possibilities, which could benefit greatly from new technologies."
      biography : "Simone Beta is Professor of Greek language and literature at the University of Siena. He is the author of numerous monographs and articles on multiple topics such as ancient theatre, rhetoric, epigrammatic poetry (especially enigmas and oracles) and reception of classical culture in the modern era. Regarding comedy, he has mostly worked on Aristophanes and his adpatations (on the history of the Lysistrata character, see *La donna che sconfigge la guerra.

      subject : "Between the symposium and the countryside: the epigrammatic *topoi* of Theocritus’ 7<sup>th</sup> Idyll"
      abstract : "Theocritus’ 7<sup>th</sup> Idyll is famous for its central section containing two short songs performed by bucolic singers, both of which refer to bits of intriguing stories and situations that seem rather loosely connected to one another. In a largely ignored paper published in 1959, François Lasserre proposed that these enclosed songs are in fact patchworks of references to epigrams composed by various persons, and furthermore, that these epigrams were part of an anthology (presumably called the Σωρός) recently published by a group of poets associated with the Alexandrian circle of avant-garde poetry. The purpose of this paper is twofold. First, I look afresh at the evidence adduced by Lasserre concerning the epigrammatic sources of Idyll 7 and propose some amendments to his theory. Second, I investigate the intermedial nature of Theocritus’ use of an epigrammatico-anthological format *within* a work like Idyll 7, which otherwise presents itself as an unambiguous piece of bucolic poetry."

      abstract: "The present contribution displays an unpublished collation of the witnesses of one of the so-called *Syllogae minores* of the *Anthologia Graeca*, the *Appendix Barberino-Vaticana*. The collation was carried out with the help of the ChrysoCollate freeware, developed by Sebastien Moureau. The collation table made it possible to optimize both data collection and analysis times, through the predictive completion of the witnesses’ variant readings, the synoptic juxtaposition of variant readings and comments, and the export of the results in ‘.odt’ format. <br> The anthological conformation of the *Appendix* lent itself well to the use of the program: each epigram constituted a work cell, divided by words or syntagms. The collation led to a revision of the *stemma codicum* of the *Sylloge* proposed so far by scholars, who based themselves on partially inaccurate collation data, repeated starting from 1890 Leo Sternbach’s reference edition. The nineteenth-century edition of the *Appendix* was also based on only two of the four witnesses known today, all examined in this analysis."

Her project focuses on the anthological tradition of ancient Greek epigram, in particular on the Appendix Barberino-Vaticana, of which she is preparing a new critical edition with Italian translation and introduction of a philological and literary nature."

      subject : "LaTeX or writing as text programming"
      abstract: "In this presentation, I will attempt to correct the idea that TeX is merely a *markup* language, in favor of the more intellectual approach taken by its author, D. Knuth, in the lecture he gave to the *American Mathematical Society* in January 1978 under the title 'Mathematical Typography' (Jan. 4, 1978). TeX, whose programming had not yet been completed, was presented as an input language based on the construction of boxes, which should be seen as atomic units, each containing a character, assembled in horizontal or vertical lists, as many times as necessary to form pages. Each box is separated from the others by a kind of glue with three components: space, extensibility and compressibility. TeX is the system that performs all the calculations required for the composition of these sets; it calculates where each character will be on the page. The drawing of each character is carried out by another language, METAFONT, which is inseparable from TeX. <br> To understand TeX as a *markup* language is therefore to ignore the great idea on which it was built, that of the page conceived as a gigantic matrix made up of 0 (white) and 1 (black), that of a purely mathematical vision at the service of the new printing machines operating on dot screens. <br> A lack of understanding of this atomic vision of TeX has led to it being reduced to a *markup* language. In fact, TeX immediately interprets a document in which you've simply inserted a few simple commands. What you don't see is that these commands are actually operating functions that process data and produce results, and that it's possible to modify them to obtain other results, or to program new functions to obtain the same or different results. TeX doesn't prescribe anything by itself; instead, it provides the text programmer with all the tools of digital writing."

      abstract : "Whether the critical edition is digital or printed, it must preserve the traditional form of the apparatus criticus as it is inherited from over two centuries of continuous tradition. We understand it as a paragraph written in Latin with nuance and economy of style. Admittedly, this way of writing is immediately accessible to human intelligence. However, it remains incomprehensible to machines. In this workshop, we will show through concrete examples how ekdosis can be used as a starting point in a “single source publishing” editorial chain. From a simple, structured source code, ekdosis can be asked to produce two completely different outputs in a single operation: one intended for traditional printing, with fully written critical notes, and the other in the form of a TEI xml database directly interpretable by machines.<br>**For this workshop, it is recommended to have a basic knowledge of LaTeX (an interactive and step-by-step method can be found on the [LearnLatex website](https://www.learnlatex.org/)). You will also need an [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/login) account or an installation of [TeXLive](https://www.tug.org/texlive/).**"
